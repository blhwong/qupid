# **Qupid**

  **Qupid**:  
Currently, there is a disconnect between customer traffic and the number of online reviews. Qupid provides a dynamic business-to-client store management system using the iBeacon technology platform to drive consumer traffic while cultivating in-depth client reviews. Users receive real-time coupons when they are in the vicinity of the iHearth. In turn, business owners are provided data-driven statistics for consumer trends and given the opportunity to collect online reviews.

- Users can browse through coupons and sort by time left, date, savings, used, expired, activated, store, etc.
- When users select a coupon to use, the app will generate a unique QR code which can be scanned at checkout
