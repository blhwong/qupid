There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  qupid

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  qupid gives retailers the ability to connect with in-store customers with just a click of a button

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Coupons and great deals get washed out by the noise of everyday life. Instead of alerting your customers of deals in the local paper where the potential transaction is 4-5 hours away. qupid gives the customer a notification of the coupon when it is most pertinent for them... In the store, making the decision.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Currently, store owners do not have a fun and interactive way to interact with their customers in the store.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  Spontanteous deals throughout the day would create a spark of transactions. On the way out, customers will be able to fill out an in-store survey to better track their demographic and performance, real-time.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "qupid started as an idea, but soon we realized we taped into the hearts of all fellow americans looking to save some money during the holiday break!"


## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  -Download qupid
  -Business Owner registers the store and place the iBeacons in hot locations based on products, while leaving one iBeacon by the cash register for the survey.
  -Inform your customers walking into the store of the new technology currently being used.


## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "qupid saved me $98.88 in Christmas Shopping this year! I was able to collect all my coupons thorughout the stores by just walking around!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
